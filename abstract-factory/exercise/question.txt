🧪 Exercise: "Virtual Pet Store"
🎯 Objective
Create a program that uses the Abstract Factory pattern to simulate the creation of pet products based on the type of animal: dog or cat.

🐶🐱 Requirements
Your system should allow the creation of compatible products for each type of pet.

Each pet has:

A specific food.

A specific toy.

🧩 Required Interfaces
Product interfaces:

Food → method: getName(): string

Toy → method: use(): void

Abstract factory:

PetFactory

createFood(): Food

createToy(): Toy

Concrete factories:

DogFactory

CatFactory

🧑‍💻 What you need to do (you can use TypeScript or pseudocode):
Implement the Food and Toy interfaces.

Create concrete classes: DogFood, DogToy, CatFood, CatToy.

Implement the concrete factories for each pet type.

Create a class PetStore that receives a PetFactory and displays the products.
